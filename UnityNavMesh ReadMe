UnityNavMesh ReadMe

In this Unity project I have played a little with the NavMesh implemented in Unity. The main objective was to understand and use the NavMesh and all its features. 
Links, areas, pathfinding or agent types are some of the subjects learnt.

In addition, to learn about NPC logic (communication, director, behabiors, etc), I have created 3 different types of agents that interact between them and move trought the NavMesh: A worker, a thief and a worker.
The worker just wanders and flees from the thief. 
The thief tries to reach certain locations and hides if seen. 
Last, the worker patrols the area and try to catch the thiefs.
